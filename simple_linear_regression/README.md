# Simple Linear Regression
### `simp_lin_reg.py`

This program runs a Boxing dataset through a simple linear regression model. It is trying 
to find the best fit line to correlate a boxers weight to how many KOs he has earned. 

## Getting Started

There are certain things you may need before getting this program working effectively.

### Prerequisites:

* [python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [matplotlib.pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_summary.html)
* [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [Boxing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/slonsky/boxing-bouts)


### How To:
1. Run from the command line using python3
2. Will display scatter plots, first of the training, second of the testing.
