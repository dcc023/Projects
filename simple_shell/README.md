# Simple Shell
### `ShantyShell.c`

A program that attempts to emulate the Unix Shell.

### How To:
* All of the builtin commands we got here are cd, pwd(not functioning properly), exit, and info.

* We've also ripped off all the non-builtins, so you can use this like the normal shell. "cat file.txt" etc.

* Every attempt of redirection was a failure, so to have this program even functional, we had to cut it.
